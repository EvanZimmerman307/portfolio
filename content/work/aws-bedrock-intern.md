**May 2025 – Aug 2025, New York, NY**

- Designed and deployed a scalable tokenizer-hosting architecture for third‑party FM providers (e.g., Anthropic) to return token counts without inference.
- Provisioned infra via TypeScript + AWS CDK; configurable compute profiles, autoscaling, and secure cross‑account networking.
- Selected SageMaker (vs. ECS) after evaluating provider experience and ops simplicity.
- Built a distributed request visibility tool across the Bedrock–Anthropic stack, reducing operator debugging time from hours to minutes.
- Worked with EKS‑based LLM inference systems; implemented fine‑grained IAM and CloudWatch log traversal for multi‑layer observability.
