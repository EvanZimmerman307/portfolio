I grew up in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C. In 2024, I graduated from the University of Virginia with a B.S. in Computer Science and I’m now pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Michigan. I’ve always played sports, and at UVA I played club rugby; those experiences shaped me to thrive in competitive, team-driven environments.
